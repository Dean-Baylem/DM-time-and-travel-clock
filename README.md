# DM Time and Travel Clock

Problem: While managing TTRPG games, the pace of the game can be slowed down significantly by managing various factors; current time, travel time, weather, day, month, season etc... 

Solution: To provide a smooth and pleasant experience for the players who pay me to run these games for them, I designed and developed a series of small apps to keep track of various details or generate various details. The DM Time and Travel Clock is one part of this package. It has the following functions:

1) Weather tracking - The current weather is displayed on screen and is updated when a "Long Rest" is used. The weather is based off a mix off random D20 results and the current season. Also an external button for if a random weather is needed by the game master.

2) Date tracking - The app keeps track of the time. Each time a 24hour period is finished, a day is added to the Date which will then update the month once the correct number of days has passed. This is also keeping track of the season and will update when the correct date has passed.

3) Travel Time Calculator - Using an input of "Method of Transport", "distance in km" and "movement speed" it will calculate the time taken for the journey and update the time and date.

4) Rest Timers - This allows you to set the current time to the entered amount.
